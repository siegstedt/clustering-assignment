# clustering assignment

Hi,

and welcome to our clustering assignment. We're absolutely excited to have you getting your hands dirty on this exercise.

Here's the situation:

We've received geographical data from a company which resembles their sales territories. The customer has 4 sales territories and asks us to:

- create one geographical structure where each territory is cut into four sub-territories, whereas each of the created sub-territories should be geographically united, and of equal size in population.
- create another geographical structure where each territory is cut into as many sub-territories as possible, whereas each of the created sub-territories should be geographically united, and each sub-territory should have a population of at least 500000.

The .ipynb gives more introduction on the data and the expected outcome formats.

In case you should have questions, reach out to Siggi: siegstedt@machinemind.io

We're excited to see your results.
